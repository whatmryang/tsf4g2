This directory contains three executable file: send, trsf, recv.
These three executable files demonstrate a message pass.
A msg was sent from 'send', through 'trsf', to 'recv',
and then, a response msg was sent from 'recv', through 'trsf', to 'send'.

In order to have a good experience with tbus,
we sugguest that you open three terminals,
and in each terminals starts one command of following:
./send 4000
./trsf 4000
./recv 4000

P.S.
The number 4000 is a GCIMShmkey, which should be the same with that in file 'tbus_mgr.xml'.
Before you can execute these command, you should have write channel fomation
into shared-memory, using the tool 'tbusmgr'with '-C tbus_mgr.xml -W' as command-line parameters.
