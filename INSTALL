Making and Installing the TSF4G Distribution
===============================================

This file provides brief instructions on how to build and install
TSF4G on UNIX (and UNIX-like) system. 

Making and Installing the TSF4G Distribution
-----------------------------------------------

1.   Unpack the distribution and change directory:

        % tar xfz tsf4g-VERSION.tgz
        % cd tsf4g-VERSION

     (replacing VERSION with the appropriate version string).  

2.   Type:

        % ./configure --help

     to list available configuration options.

     Note also that the configure script uses environmental variables
     for determining compiler/linker options including:

        Variable        Description     Example
        CC              C compiler      gcc
        CFLAGS          C flags         -O -g
        CPPFLAGS        cpp flags       -I/usr/local/include/mysql
        LDFLAGS         ld flags        -L/usr/local/lib/mysql
        LIBS            libraries       -llib
        PATH            command path    /usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin

     See appendix A for generic configure options documentation.

3.   Configure the build system:

        % [env settings] ./configure [options]


     e.g. %./configure CPPFLAGS="-I/usr/local/include/mysql" LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/lib/mysql/" 
		 
     If all goes well, the configure script will automatically detect
     the appropriate settings.  If the configure script fails, you
     should read the config.log file that it generated to see what it
     was trying to do and exactly what failed.  You may need to specify
     additional options and/or environment variables besides those
     listed above to obtain desired results, or you may need to preinstal
     software packages depended by TSF4G.
     

4.   Build the system:

        % make

     If all goes well, the system will build as configured.  If
     not, return to step 2 after reviewing your configuration
     settings.  

5.   Test the system:

        % make test

     If all goes well, the system has been built as configured.  If
     not, return to step 2 after reviewing your configuration
     settings.  

6.   Install the software.  You may need to be come the super-user
     (e.g. root) to do this (depending on where you are installing
     things):

        % su root -c 'make install'

7.   That's it.  Enjoy!

Appendix A configure options

Optional Features:
  --disable-FEATURE       do not include FEATURE (same as --enable-FEATURE=no)
  --enable-FEATURE[=ARG]  include FEATURE [ARG=yes]
  --enable-debug          enable debugging,generate debug version of TSF4G. no|yes [no]
 
Optional Packages:
  --with-PACKAGE[=ARG]    use PACKAGE [ARG=yes]
  --without-PACKAGE       do not use PACKAGE (same as --with-PACKAGE=no)
  --with-obus    with old bus library in tsf4g library [no]
  --with-sec    with sec library in tsf4g library  [yes]

Some influential environment variables:
  CC          C compiler command
  CFLAGS      C compiler flags
  LDFLAGS     linker flags, e.g. if you have libraries in a nonstandard directory(/usr/local/lib/mysql), 
  						set LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/lib/mysql"
  CPPFLAGS    C/C++ preprocessor flags, e.g.  if you have headers in a nonstandard
  						 directory(/usr/local/include/mysql),	set CPPFLAGS="-I/usr/local/include/mysql"
